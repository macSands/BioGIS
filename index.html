<h2>BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT PLAN - WONDERFONTEIN COMPLEX [MAY 2019]</h2>
<p>
During the period xxxx and xxxx, various biodiversity related specialist studies were conducted in the Wonderfontein Complex surface rights area (included as Supporting Documents).  
A Biodiversity Managament Plan (BMP) was then compiled for Wonderfontein Complex (Report no. xxxxx) by integrating all the important biodiversity-related aspects from these 
specialist studies in a single report to provide guidance on the management of important biodiversity aspects within the study area.  
<p>
A follow-up study was conducted during the xxxx period with the aim of conducting focussed specialist assessments and monitoring (included in Supporting Documents).  
The latest information (pertained in these various specialist reports) were then used to update the BMP for Wonderfontein Complex [xxxx update] (included under Biodiversity Management). 
The BMP is a standalone document providing an overview of the important biodiversity-related aspects of the Wonderfontein Complex, making reference to relevant specialist reports 
where more detail can be sourced.  
<p>
The Biodiversity Management Plan furthermore goes hand in hand with this interactive GIS-product.  
One of the main features of the GIS-product is that spatial biodiversity information can be viewed which enables the overlay of different biodiversity aspects on aerial views of the mining area.  
The GIS-product can be used as an important tool in mine planning and especially in biodiversity management on the Wonderfontein Complex.
